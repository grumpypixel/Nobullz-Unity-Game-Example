# Nobull Unity Game Example

This is an example of how to use the [Nobullz Unity Game Boilerplate](https://github.com/grumpypixel/Nobullz-Unity-Game-Boilerplate). The boilerplate code has been stripped down so that the only code in this repo is code that is actually needed to run the dummy game.

## Basic structure

This example consists of three scenes: a main scene, which acts as the entry point, a menu scene and a game scene. Each scene has its own state, a main state, a menu state and a game state. There's a play button in the menu scene to load the game scene, and then there's a home button in the game scene which brings you back to the menu scene.

## Dependencies

- [Unity](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download) version 2018.3.7f1 or higher

## Usage

- Open Unity
- Load the 'main' scene into Unity
- Press 'Play'
- Click your brains out
